What is realHTML4Natural?
-------------------------

RealHTML4Natural is a web framework for Natural. It allows you to write your own HTML code where you don't have to use predefined controls. It does not rely on one big Natural Session (like N4Aj), every HTTP request (when the route it is defined to call a Natural subprogram) is a new Natural session. So it is thread save and you can make real asynchronous request with Java script.
Your skills are the limit here.
